# Re-create this

Hi Jonas,

I totally forgot to branch out when working on different sections, but I remembered at one point and I have done it since. There are many things that can be inproved, like "overflow: hidden" for the recommendations list and the microinteractions are poor.

I really wanted to make it dynamic, but I'm a bit short of time, but for the moment I will hand it in as it is.

Thank you your time!
